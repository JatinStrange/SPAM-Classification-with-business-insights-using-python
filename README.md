# SPAM-Classification-with-business-insights-using-python

About Dataset

This dataset is collected from here. I just used enron1 folder. It contains two folders of spam and ham. Each folder contains emails. I iterated to each text file of those folders and created a dataframe and written to a csv file. This can be helpful for others.

Objective:

1). To classify the e-mails into spam and ham.

2). To find out the topics used mostly in spam mails which will help in running marketing campaigns.

3). Gather meaningful business insights.

BUSINESS INSIGHTS:

1). The subject line should not be verbose

2). The body should be concise

3). Words such as “free”, “cheap”, expensive brand names should be avoided
